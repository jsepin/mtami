BACKGROUND: Adolescents' mental health declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
yet little is known about the long-term outcomes after the pandemic's 
declassification as a global health emergency (5 May 2023). This study examined 
changes in adolescent mental health in Iceland from 2016 to 2023, using a 
bioecological framework to identify risk and protective factors.
METHODS: Youth in Iceland surveys were administered nationwide to 
13-15-year-olds in 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, with an average 75% 
response rate across the years. The surveys included measures on depressive 
symptoms, anxiety and hostility (Symptom Checklist-90), parental social support 
(Perceived Parental Support Scale), screen time, and stress/trauma exposure 
(Negative Life Events Scale). Stepwise-reduced mixed-effects models assessed the 
association of age, gender, time and risk/protective factors and their effect on 
mental health. Multiple imputation addressed missing data, and Bonferroni 
corrections adjusted for multiple testing.
FINDINGS: 62,011 adolescents participated: 48.2% female (n = 29,890), 50.0% male 
(n = 31,002), 1.8% non-binary (n = 1119). Depressive symptoms showed signs of 
improvement post-pandemic (2023) compared to 2021 (β 0.19, 95% CI 0.13-0.24), 
yet remained higher than pre-pandemic levels (2016: β -0.38, 95% CI -0.44 to 
-0.33; 2018: β -0.26, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.20). Anxiety and hostility also 
increased and remained higher than pre-pandemic levels in 2023 (anxiety: 2016 β 
-0.29, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.24, 2018 β -0.20, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.15; hostility: 
2016 β -0.26, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.20, 2018 β -0.12, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.07). 
Across all the models examining the predictors from diverse bioecological 
spheres, low parental social support, high social media use, and bad grades were 
consistently associated with poor mental health, regardless of mental health 
outcome and gender.
INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a serious and continuing negative 
effect on adolescents' mental health. Targeted interventions are needed to 
address the increase in mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
with a focus on enhancing parental support and managing screen use.

BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are now frequently incorporated 
into multiple myeloma (MM) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to help inform 
clinical decision making. Although the quality of PRO components in cancer RCT 
protocols is generally recognized as suboptimal, there are limited data on 
adherence to international quality standards in MM RCT protocols.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review to identify MM RCTs published between 
January 2014 and June 2023 that utilized the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The 
quality of PRO-specific protocol content was evaluated using the SPIRIT-PRO 
guidelines, which establish key requirements for PRO inclusion in protocols. The 
framework consists of 16 items: 5 elaborations of the existing SPIRIT checklist 
and 11 PRO-specific extensions items. The quality of PRO reporting was evaluated 
using CONSORT-PRO Extension, which comprises 14 items to improve the reporting 
of PRO data in clinical trials.
RESULTS: Our systematic review identified 35 RCTs encompassing 20,612 patients, 
with 24 trials (69%) having publicly accessible protocols. The median protocol 
compliance was 7.5 SPIRIT-PRO items. Analysis of 24 protocols showed strong 
compliance in assessment schedules (96%), PRO domains/instrument justification 
(79%), and PRO objectives (71%). Intervention deviation procedures were 
described in 62% of protocols. Half included comprehensive data collection 
plans, while 58% addressed missing data methods and 42% outlined PRO research 
questions or multiplicity controls. Notably weak areas included strategies for 
preventing missing data (38%), and only 8% of protocols detailed PRO monitoring 
plans, personnel specifications, or eligibility criteria. CONSORT-PRO scores 
varied across all 35 RCTs (median 11, range 0.5-14). Among the 35 RCTs, while 
trials showed strong reporting of statistical elements (94% precision estimates, 
91% subgroup analyses, 89% intention-to-treat, 86% timepoint completion) and 
results (80% hypothesized domains, 71% PRO validity, 69% clinical implications, 
66% limitations), key PRO-specific components were reported by less than 
two-thirds of RCTs: only 11% stated PRO hypotheses, 31% specified administration 
mode, 43% identified domains, 60% addressed missing data, and 63% provided PRO 
rationale. Two factors were associated with higher reporting quality, both 
potentially reflecting publication bias: having a secondary PRO-focused paper 
(p < 0.001) and finding statistically significant EORTC QLQ-C30 differences 
(p = 0.024). Our multivariable analysis showed no significant association 
between SPIRIT-PRO scores and CONSORT-PRO scores.
CONCLUSION: Despite some foundational strengths of existing MM RCT protocols, 
gaps exist in PRO methodological specifications, statistical analysis, and 
clinical interpretation. Our findings may help to better inform PRO 
implementation in future MM RCT protocols. For example, since missing PRO data 
can be due to informative censoring, there should be increased attention on 
considering how to minimize missing data, already at the stage of protocol 
writing. Our findings regarding predictors of higher reporting quality suggest 
that trials with significant PRO differences receive systematically better 
reporting, possibly introducing bias in the available evidence base.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of evidence-based Enhanced Recovery 
After Surgery (ERAS) nursing protocols in patients undergoing robotic-assisted 
partial nephrectomy using the Da Vinci system.
METHODS: A total of 240 patients undergoing Da Vinci robot-assisted partial 
nephrectomy were randomized (1:1) to ERAS (n = 120) or conventional care 
(n = 120) groups using a stratified block randomization method. The sample size 
was calculated based on a power of 80%, α = 0.05, and anticipated clinically 
significant differences, though specific values for the standard deviation and 
effect size were not disclosed. Primary outcomes included operative time, 
estimated blood loss, and length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes assessed 
complication rates (Clavien-Dindo classification) and patient-reported comfort 
(Kolcaba GCQ questionnaire). Categorical variables were analyzed using the 
Chi-square test, while continuous variables were assessed with the independent 
samples t-test. Bonferroni correction was applied for pairwise comparisons to 
control for multiple testing. All analyses adhered to the modified 
intention-to-treat principle using the full analysis set (FAS), and no 
imputation was made for missing data. A p-value < 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: The ERAS group demonstrated superior recovery metrics compared to the 
control group: operative duration (228.6 ± 9.5 vs. 252.8 ± 10.1 min, mean 
difference [MD] - 24.2, 95% CI -27.3, -21.1; p < 0.001), intraoperative blood 
loss (200.4 ± 18.2 vs. 232.6 ± 19.3 mL, MD - 32.2, 95% CI -36.8, -27.6; 
p < 0.001), and shorter postoperative milestones (ambulation: 14.3 ± 1.7 vs. 
18.7 ± 2.2 h, p < 0.001; catheter removal: 2.1 vs. 3.5 days, p < 0.001). 
Hospital stay was significantly reduced (6.2 ± 2.1 vs. 10.5 ± 3.3 days, MD 
- 4.3, 95% CI -5.0, -3.6; p < 0.001). Complication rates were markedly lower 
with ERAS (14.2% vs. 39.2%, relative risk [RR] 0.36, 95% CI 0.24-0.55; 
p < 0.001), particularly for urinary infections (3.3% vs. 11.7%, p = 0.027) and 
wound hematomas (5.0% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.025). GCQ scores improved significantly 
in the ERAS group post-intervention (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: ERAS nursing grounded in evidence-based medicine significantly 
enhances postoperative recovery, reduces complications, and improves patient 
comfort in robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy. These findings support its 
broader clinical adoption.

OBJECTIVES: To systematically investigate trustworthiness (methodological rigor, 
transparency, good governance, research integrity, and absence of misconduct) in 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of osteopathic manual therapy.
METHODS: This prospectively registered review (PROSPERO-ID: CRD42023457697) 
searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, ostmed.dr, and Chiroindex for 
RCTs evaluating osteopathic treatments (January 2021-June 2024). Risk of bias 
(RoB) was assessed using Cochrane tool 2, while trustworthiness was assessed 
with the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Screening Tool and the REAPPRAISED 
checklist. Journal trustworthiness, misleading representations in abstracts 
("spin"), and results plausibility (via meta-analysis) were also assessed. 
Findings were synthesized descriptively.
RESULTS: Sixty-one RCTs were included (median sample size 45, interquartile 
range (IQR) 30-76), largely studying healthy volunteers (29%). Most had high RoB 
(74%), and only 7% acknowledged potential conflicts from authors' professional 
ties. No journals appeared on cautionary lists, although 23% of articles were 
published within 2 months of submission. Only 27% of contactable authors engaged 
with reviewers. Seven abstracts (12%) were free of spin. Methodological concerns 
included poor missing data handling (31%), selective analyses (38%), 
unacknowledged multiple testing (36%), and outcome switching (12%). 
Meta-analysis found two outliers and five further with very large effects, while 
19% provided inadequate data for pooling. Limitations include incomplete reports 
and lack of validated trustworthiness assessment tools.
CONCLUSION: Adherence to best practices in osteopathic RCTs needs improvement to 
enhance evidence-based decision-making, reduce research waste, and enhance 
reproducibility. Further research should explore whether these findings apply to 
other small, under-resourced fields.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Clinical trials are studies that test if medical 
treatments work. Doctors and others use these studies to decide how to care for 
patients or which treatments should be paid for. For clinical trials to be 
helpful, they need to follow rules to show they can be trusted. For example, 
researchers can build trust by sharing their plans before they start, reporting 
all their results honestly and answering questions about their work. In this 
project, we looked at 61 clinical trials from a 3.5-year period that tested a 
hands-on treatment called "osteopathic manual therapy." We checked how well 
these trials followed the rules for trustworthy research. We found that many 
trials had problems. For example, important research steps were skipped (such as 
properly registering the study on appropriate online platforms before starting, 
following the steps described in the registration documents, and correctly 
examining the collected data). Often, results were also made to look better than 
they really are, or it was not clearly explained what happened during the study. 
Only a few researchers answered questions when we asked them. This shows that 
some osteopathic trials need to do better so people can trust the results. We 
also suggest ways researchers can improve trustworthiness in the future.

From 2006 to 2024, I have carried out statistical reviews of about 700 
manuscripts for Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases and RMD open. My most frequent 
review comments concern the following: 1. Report how missing data were handled. 
2. Limit the number of covariates in regression analyses. 3. Do not use stepwise 
selection of covariates. 4. Validate prediction models. 5. Adjust for baseline 
values in randomised controlled trials. 6. Do not adjust for baseline values in 
observational studies. 7. Dichotomising a continuous variable can be a bad idea. 
8. Student t test is better than nonparametric tests. 9. Mean (SD) are also 
relevant for nonnormally distributed data. 10. Adjusting P values for 
multiplicity. 11. Report estimate, CI, and (possibly) P value-in that order of 
importance. 12. Do not test for baseline imbalances in a randomised controlled 
trial. 13. Format for reporting CIs. 14. Mind the number of reported decimal 
places. 15. Report absolute numbers where relevant.

There is a long history in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) of promoting 
therapies based on phase 2 data, which then fail in phase 3 trials. Experience 
suggests that studies of 6 months in duration are too short, especially with 
function-based outcome measures. Multiplicity poses a serious threat to data 
interpretation, and strategies to impute missing data may not be appropriate for 
ALS where progression is always expected. Emerging surrogate markers of clinical 
benefit such as reduction of neurofilament light chain levels may be better 
suited to phase 2 go/no-go decisions. Over-interpretation of phase 2 data, and 
overly optimistic communication of exploratory analyses must be avoided to 
ensure optimal prioritization for the investment needed for definitive phase 3 
trials and to minimize the harm of false hope for people living with ALS. 
Delivering on advances in understanding of the neurobiology of ALS requires 
urgent attention to phase 2 design and implementation.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Test efficacy of the social emotional learning 
(SEL)-based Mighty Girls program, a program culturally tailored for 
English-speaking Hispanic/Latino girls in seventh grade comprised of classroom 
sessions and a virtual reality computer game. We hypothesized that the 
curriculum would decrease risky sexual behaviors in a program that can be used 
as part of a comprehensive sex education curriculum or as a stand-alone program.
METHODS: A randomized group trial was conducted in which 22 low-income, 
predominately Hispanic schools within the Miami-Dade County Public School System 
were randomly assigned to intervention (consented n = 335) and control 
(consented n = 217) conditions. All study activities occurred after school. 
Primary outcome measures were resistance self-efficacy, acceptance of dating 
violence, sexual intentions, and sexual behavior. Assessments occurred at 
baseline, immediately post-intervention, 3-, 12-, and 24-months 
post-intervention. Changes in outcomes from baseline to 24 months were modeled 
using multi-level models to account for nesting of students within schools with 
full information maximum likelihood to account for missing data and baseline 
school attendance and enrollment in free and reduced lunch as covariates. 
Analyses are also controlled for multiple testing.
RESULTS: The program had a significant effect on reducing acceptance of dating 
violence at 24 months post-intervention (estimate = -0.083, p ≤ 0.05), but no 
effect on resistance self-efficacy, sexual intentions, or sexual behavior (p ≥ 
0.58).
CONCLUSION: Study findings demonstrate that a social emotional learning (SEL) 
curriculum can impact sexual behaviors such as susceptibility to dating 
violence. Low baseline levels for sexual intentions and behaviors as well as a 
high baseline of efficacy may have impacted findings for the other outcomes.

CONTEXT: Although biological findings show that estrogens are beneficial for 
muscular mass maintenance and bone resorption inhibition, the association of 
hormonal exposure with physical performance are controversial.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of reproductive history and exogenous 
hormone use with hand-grip strength (GS) in women.
METHODS: Using the data from the CONSTANCES French prospective population-based 
cohort study, we ran linear mixed models to investigate the association of 
reproductive history and exogenous hormones use with maximal GS in 37 976 women 
aged 45 to 69 years recruited between 2012 and 2020. We used multiple imputation 
by chained equations to control missing values and corrections for multiple 
testing.
RESULTS: The mean age of women was 57.2 years. Mean GS was 26.6 kg. After 
adjustment for age and confounders, GS increased with age at menarche (β+1 year 
= 0.14; 95% CI, 0.10-0.17) and duration of breastfeeding (β for ≥10 months vs <5 
months = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20-0.59; P for linear trend <.01). Compared to 
nonmenopausal women, postmenopausal women had significantly lower GS (β = -0.78; 
95% CI, -0.98 to -0.58). GS was negatively associated with hormone therapy (HT) 
past use (β = -0.25; 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.07).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that menopausal transition was strongly 
associated with lower GS. However, despite our hypothesis, increased age at 
menarche and duration of breastfeeding were associated with higher GS and HT 
past users presented lower GS than HT never users. These findings could help 
identify women at high risk of poor physical performance.

BACKGROUND: To investigate changes in the immunophenotypes of androgen receptor 
(AR), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), synaptophysin (Syn), chromogranin A 
(CgA), p53 and Ki-67 after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) for prostate 
cancer (PCa) and to analyze their clinical significance.
METHODS: Paired paraffin samples were collected from 40 PCa patients before and 
after NET, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect AR, PSA, Syn, CgA, p53 
and Ki-67 expression. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Kaplan‒Meier 
survival curves were plotted for analysis of PSA and Ki-67 expression in 
relation to progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: After NET, the mean scores for PSA and Ki-67 expression in PCa patients 
were lower than those before NET (P < 0.05), while the mean scores for Syn and 
CgA expression were higher than those before NET (P < 0.05). The mean Gleason 
score and WHO/ISUP (World Health Organization/International Society of 
Urological Pathology) grade after NET were lower than those before NET 
(P < 0.05). In PCa patients who had not yet received NET, PSA expression 
correlated positively with Gleason score and WHO/ISUP grade and negatively with 
Ki-67 expression (P < 0.05); p53 expression correlated negatively with Gleason 
score and WHO/ISUP grade (P < 0.05). TCGA showed that PFS was lower in PCa 
patients with high PSA and Ki-67 expression (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: PSA and Ki-67 protein expressions decreased significantly in PCa 
patients after NET and can be used as biological markers for prognostic 
assessment of PCa patients. NETs may induce a neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype in 
PCa. Monitoring the immunophenotypes of PCa patients after NET may inform 
assessment of efficacy and prognosis.

The Setting International Standards in Analyzing Patient-Reported Outcomes and 
Quality of Life Endpoints Data (SISAQOL) initiative was established in 2016 to 
assess the quality and standardization of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) data 
analysis in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on advanced breast cancer. The 
initiative identified deficiencies in PRO data reporting, including 
nonstandardized methods for handling missing data. This study evaluated the 
reporting of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in Japanese cancer RCTs to 
provide insights into the state of PRO reporting in Japan. The study reviewed 
PubMed articles published from 2010 to 2018. Eligible studies included Japanese 
cancer RCTs with ≥50 adult patients (≥50% were Japanese) with solid tumors 
receiving anticancer treatments. The evaluation criteria included clarity of the 
HRQOL hypotheses, multiplicity testing, primary analysis methods, and reporting 
of clinically meaningful differences. Twenty-seven HRQOL trials were identified. 
Only 15% provided a clear HRQOL hypothesis, and 63% examined multiple HRQOL 
domains without adjusting for multiplicity. Model-based methods were the most 
common statistical methods for the primary HRQOL analysis. Only 22% of the 
trials explicitly reported clinically meaningful differences in HRQOL. Baseline 
assessments were reported in most trials, but only 26% reported comparisons 
between the treatment groups. HRQOL analysis was based on the intention-to-treat 
population in 19% of the trials, and 74% reported compliance at follow-up; 
however, 41% did not specify how missing values were handled. Although the rates 
of reporting clinical hypotheses and clinically meaningful differences were 
relatively low, the current state of HRQOL evaluation in the Japanese cancer RCT 
appears comparable to that of previous studies.
